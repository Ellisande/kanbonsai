    <h3>When Should I Use It?</h3>
    <p>Lean Coffee works best for meetings that don't have a specific reoccuring agenda. The "let's catch up" meetings.</p>
    <h3>Is it safe?</h3>
    <p>Lean Coffee does not store any data entered into it. As soon as you leave a room it is all cleaned up. Information is stored only in volatile memory, with no permanent storage of any kind.</p>
