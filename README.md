# Lean Coffee

## Introduction
There is a new style of meeting that is gaining tracition amongst large organizations called Lean Coffee. Lean Coffee is a way to approach meetings that have no strongly defined agenda.

### Basic Process
The process of Lean Coffee follows these basic steps:

* Everyone submits topics (2-3 mintues)
* Similar topics are merged (1-2 minutes)
* Everyone votes on the topics (1-3 minutes)
 * Each person has 3 votes they can use any way they like
* Main body of the meeting
 * Take the topic with the most votes
 * Talk about the topic (3 minutes)
 * At the end of three minutes everyone votes on whether or not to continue talking about the topic
  * If they vote yes, keep talking
  * If they vote no, remove the topic and repeat the main body steps again
* Main body is repeated until the meeting is over

### Benefits
Lean Coffee has a couple of great benefits from a meeting perspective.

* __Simplicity__ - The rules are very simple to explain and understand
* __Efficiency__ - The topics with the most interest are talked about first, and for the longest
* __Focused__ - Each topic is talked about only while there is overwhelming interest, reducing swirl
* __Dynamic__ - Lean Coffee allows you to have productive meetings even when it is implausible or impossible to create detailed agendas ahead of time.
